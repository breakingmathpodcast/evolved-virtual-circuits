# Evolved Circuits (evolvedcircuits)

To run, all you have to do is type `python3 -iOO ElectricEvolution.py` to watch an example evolution run!

The runs should approximate an offset and scaled sinc function (the cloness of which is measured by the square of the cosine of the angle between the ideal and generated fitnesses).
