# Evolved Circuits (evolvedcircuits)

To run, all you have to do is type `python3 -iOO ElectricEvolution.py` to watch an example evolution run!

The runs should approximate an offset and scaled sinc function (the cloness of which is measured by the square of the cosine of the angle between the ideal and generated fitnesses).

This project requires `akhab` to be installed, which can be done through `pip`.

When we have time, we will make a more complete tutorial.
